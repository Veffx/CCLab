                <p>Deep-Sea Plankton-096</p>

                <h3 class="red">Discovered by / at:</h3>
                <p>Dr.Han, 2024</p>

                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>This organism has many similar species near deep-sea volcanoes. They reproduce asexually, with most genetic variations arising from the immense pressure of the deep sea and the intense heat generated by volcanic activity. Overall, there are few subspecies or variants.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>Near the crater of a submarine volcano.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>The organism's overall appearance resembles a continuously opening and closing spherical structure. Its locomotion organs consist of four wing-like, cell membrane-like structures surrounding the central, core-shaped digestive organ. These small wings continuously open and close to circulate surrounding water, enabling movement and the absorption of nutrients from seawater. Each wing is composed of numerous small, spherical structures woven together in a ring-like formation.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Key Characteristics:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>It adapts to its environment by changing its size in response to seawater concentration.</li>
                    <li>Its body color shifts due to variations in enzyme activity caused by thermal energy changes. </li>
                    <li>Its digestive organ is a small, central, nucleus-like structure.</li>
    
                </ul>

    <span class="yellow">What we know so far about it?</span>This organism is edible, highly resilient to extreme environments, and possesses a high energy conversion efficiency. Due to these traits, scientists are attempting to mass-produce it and explore its potential for use as food or in biodiesel production. However, it has not yet been introduced to the market.
